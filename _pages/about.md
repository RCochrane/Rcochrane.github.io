Introduction
======
Currently, I am training through the Biochemistry PhD program in Dr. Karas's lab, which focuses on developing innovative strategies for genome engineering. I study _Phaeodactylum tricornutum_, a eukaryotic micro-algae, and have created a platform for rapid organelle genome engineering in this model system. My research interests include: 1) organelle genome structure and evolution, & 2) developing novel biotechologies.

The goal of my thesis is the development of technologies required to for the first-in-the-world method for whole mitochondrial genome replacement in a diatomaceous algae _Phaeodactylum tricornutum_. This will require systems for cloning and engineering of the mitochondrial genome, and methods for DNA delivery to the diatom's mitochondrial compartment.

* **Figure 1. Simplified Thesis Overview.** To deliver whole mitochondrial genomes to _Phaeodactylum tricornutum_'s mitochondria my thesis encompasses two main objectives. First, cloning and engineering of _P. tricornutum_ â€™s mitochondrial genome, and then second development of the methods for its delivery back to the mitochondria.
