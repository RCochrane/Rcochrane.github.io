Introduction
======
Currently, I am training through the Biochemistry PhD program in Dr. Karas's lab, which focuses on developing innovative strategies for genome engineering. I study _Phaeodactylum tricornutum_, a eukaryotic micro-algae, and have created a platform for rapid organelle genome engineering in this model system. My research interests include: 1) organelle genome structure and evolution, & 2) developing novel biotechologies.
